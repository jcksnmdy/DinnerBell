## Build Instructions

Before you run the website, make sure you have NPM installed and run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` to install all relevant packages.

With that done, run ```ionic serve``` to build the website and host it on the localhost at port 8100. (or any other if you use ```--port={ port # }```)

## On Comments

Due to the volume of files in this project, we decided to write comments in the ```.page.ts``` file for each page to save time.
